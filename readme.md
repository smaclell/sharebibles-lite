1. In order to run this app make sure you can run the [react-native base app](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) building projects with native code.

2. Run `yarn global add exp` to install the expo commandline tool

3. Run `yarn start` or `yarn run android` or `yarn run ios`

4. Using the expo app on your phone see the awesomeness you have created!

Create a card on the trello board if this does not work for you.
